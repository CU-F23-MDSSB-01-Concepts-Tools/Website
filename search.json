We try to care, if we are not too busy with other things. If you do, please do first: Document and describe where you get stuck as precise as possible. Try to find out why as much as possible.\n\nThe instructors prefer that you ask for help in the Discussions section of the Organization repo https://github.com/CU-F23-MDSSB-01-Concepts-Tools/Organization/discussions.

Authenticate git to access your GitHub content\nBefore you can clone your repository you need to tell GitHub that you are authorized to do this, and to that end you need to make a Personal Access Token (PAT) in your GitHub account and make this available to git and RStudio on your local machine.\nThere are several ways to do this (e.g. from the command line) but as we will use RStudio anyway, we can use a convenient way provided there. Read more about PATs and how to use them in Happy Git with R: Personal access token for HTTPS (in particular the TL;DR which describes what we use).\nOpen RStudio and install the packages usethis and gitcreds if you haven’t done already: Go to the “Console” pane at the bottom left. Type in\ninstall.packages(c(\"usethis\",\"gitcreds\"))\nand hit Enter. Now the packages should be installed.\nNow, use two commands. Copy them to the console and click Enter:\nusethis::create_github_token()\nThis opens http://github.com and you may need to log in. Then you can make the PAT (read more details in “Happy Git with R”). For today, you can go the fast way and do not think about the options and click “Generate token”. (If you feel safe enough you can also go for a token without an expiration day against advise from GitHub, if not you just have to do the “dance” again when the PAT expires.)\nUse the clipboard icon 📋 to copy the PAT. Go back to RStudio and do in the console:\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\nIn the dialog in the console paste your PAT from the clipboard and press Enter. That should be it and you do not need to repeat these steps until the PAT expires. (If the PAT expires you have to make a new one in the same way.)"

This is maybe a good model to detect and memorize shapes, but it has nothing to do with these animals.\nEvery model is a simplification of the real world, but there are good and bad models (for particular purposes).\nA skeptical (but constructive) approach to a model is always advisable."

    "text": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy\nThis policy covers any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Elicit, etc. This includes text, code, slides, artwork/graphics/video/audio and other products.\nWe instructors encouraged to using and exploring AI tools for these purposes:\n\nLearning by dialog with a chatbot. AI chatbots can be very helpful to explain you concepts on your desired level and get a feeling about how certain topics are treated. You can ask for an easier or more detailed explanation or focus on certain aspects. Note: The capabilities are limited and you likely receive a lot of false information! Using chatbots should remain a small part of your learning process. Rule of thumb: Spend not more than 25% of the learing time with chatting. There is no way around reading textbooks, reading software documentation, learning and understanding concepts, searching for help online, asking instructors or fellow students.\nHave code snippets written. Tools like GitHub Copilot (free to use for students and teachers in VSCode) are heavily used and currently revolutionize code writting a bit. They can speed up writung your code. However, they do not deliver always correct solutions. There is no way around understanding yourself what a code is doing! Do not spend endless hours asking for new code with new prompts, spend time understanding a language and the functions and objects you are using! Copilots can be a great help to get a skeleton of code and an idea how your solution might look, they rarely deliver the complete code, expect that the code does not work, expect that the code seems to works but the results are wrong. You are 100% accountable for the code you produce, with or without the help of a copilot!\nHave a draft text snippet written. Data science is also about formulating and describing research questions, describing data, documenting code, interpreting results, and deriving conclusion form the results. This is all verbal text and chatbots are good in writing text which often appears as well readable. You can use this inspire you and to polish and improve your texts. However, you are 100% accountable for the text you deliver. You are expected to know what your text is about and to be able to answer questions about what your text means! Text generated purely by chatbots, it often becomes evident that you do not. We consider such cases worse than incomplete but sensible text. Also text written by chatbots is often very generic and less specific. In general, we value more specific text higher than generic text. Large parts of very generic text is considered worse than a shorter more specific text. In extreme case, we may a long very generic text will be considered worse than no text at all\nNote: Philosophical and legal questions around the training and use of chatbots and code copilots are controversially contested and re-examined constantly! We encourage to engage with such questions and become aware of arguments and debates.\n\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to us for a conversation before submitting your work."

Some people even make a business publishing short snippets because they love communicating about data science but also trying to attract you to their newsletters or courses. Also many developers of R or python packages are on social media occasionally posting new releases, ideas, or reacting."

    "text": "2 Should you follow data science on social media?\nYes, you should! Because\n\nyou can get a feeling of how the field develops.\nyou can find nice snippets to learn things, when lucky they are exactly on your level.\nmany people learn data science things on social media, you react with a questions and may be lucky to get a response.\nthere may sometimes be release for your confused mind through data science memes, cartoons, or jokes.\n\nNo, you should not! Because\n\nall social media is disctraction from focused learning and concentrated working.\nyou may develop imposter syndrome symptoms. There is so much stuff out and you may think everybody else knows so much more and you will never catch up. (Hint, the reality is more like this: No one knows everything, you already have your own perspective and own unique set of skills, every good data scientist is constantly learning and is constantly able to rethink and also sometimes has similar feelings, what gets pushed on social media tends to be more opinionated and overstated.)\nyou may fall into hype topics where people overstate the importance, risks, dangers, or opportunities a lot.\n\nFinal answer: You decide. If you do, learn to stop when it feels bad, learn to detect hype, and do more other data science learning: real exercises, tutorials or your projects. Just assume you are in the blue region on the graph in this cartoon 😉."

    "text": "3 Which social media and how to follow data science?\nThe following is not intended to be complete or balanced in anyway. If you find something interesting let me know and I may add it to the lists.\nFor following Data Science in social media you often need platform accounts, otherwise most platform do not even let you see things. Anyway, accounts help you by selecting who to follow. You do not need to post or like things, you can start just looking around and following.\nThe general ways to access content is by following interesting people, searching for words or hashtags, or use the explore options the platforms offer.\nFor sure data science is a common topic on 𝕏 (which I still call Twitter which is still the URL), Reddit , and Mastodon .\nOn Mastodon: It is not a propriatary service, it is offering a joint open source protocol which different independent servers can use to run something like a decentralized twitter. Some people call it Twitter with an open protocol like email. I think, this is a very good development! When you want to have a mastodon account, you need to decide for a server where to live. In the end it is not so important because you can follow people on all servers and you can also move with your account later. I am in the community https://datasci.social but you could take anythings.\nAfter Elon Musk’s twitter take over microblogging people are a but puzzled where to go and many maintain more than one plattform like twitter/X, bluesky, threads, or mastodon (which I support most). So, you may find the same people at different places."

    "text": "This is an excersise combining knowledge about logarithms and probability distributions and a statistical test.\nExercise: Analyzing Data with Benford’s Law in R\nBackground: Benford’s Law, also known as the First-Digit Law, is a phenomenon where in many naturally occurring datasets, the leading digit (i.e., the first digit) is more likely to be small, such as 1, 2, or 3, than it is to be large, such as 8 or 9. This law has applications in fraud detection, financial auditing, and data integrity verification.\nTask: You are given a dataset in a CSV file named data.csv. Your task is to perform the following steps using R and data analytics libraries to determine if the dataset follows Benford’s Law:\nData Loading: Read the data from data.csv into a data frame using read.csv().\n\nData Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Display summary statistics, and visualize the distribution of the first digits in the dataset using a histogram.\n\nCalculate Expected Benford's Law Frequencies: Calculate the expected frequency of each first digit (1 through 9) according to Benford's Law. You can use the formula:\n\nP(d)=log⁡10(d+1)−log⁡10(d)P(d)=log10​(d+1)−log10​(d)\n\nWhere P(d)P(d) is the expected proportion of numbers starting with digit dd.\n\nCompare Observed vs. Expected Frequencies: Calculate the observed frequency of each first digit in the dataset. Compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies from Benford's Law. Create a bar chart or similar visualization to illustrate the comparison.\n\nHypothesis Testing: Perform a statistical hypothesis test to determine if the dataset significantly deviates from Benford's Law. You can use a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test to assess the deviation.\n\nConclusion: Based on the results of your analysis, draw conclusions about whether the dataset follows or deviates from Benford's Law. Explain your findings and their implications.\nNote:\nYou may assume that the dataset contains numerical values.\nYou can use R packages like readr for data reading, and ggplot2 for data visualization.\nInclude comments in your code to explain your approach and calculations.\nProvide clear visualizations and explanations in your final report.\nBonus (Optional): If you’d like to extend this exercise, you can consider applying Benford’s Law to more complex datasets or exploring other variations of the law, such as the Second-Digit Law or the Benford’s Law for Two-Digit Numbers using R."
