You can also use the website for accompanying self-study on selected topics.\nA core resource for self-learning data science with R is R for Data Science https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ by Hadley Wickham and the R data science community around. This is a valuable resource for self-studying particular topics using tidyverse tools. Just out: Tidy Modeling with R https://www.tmwr.org/ by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge on using tidymodels.\nA core resource for data science basics with python is the Python Data Science Handbook https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/ by Jake VanderPlas. Also there is a good video playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkmRvnFmOd4KhDdlK1oIq23 and a 4-hour “full-course” video https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw.\n\n\n\nSome helpful YouTube videos for those recaping maths:\nHow to read math https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp2bYWRQylk\n\n\n\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis https://ggplot2-book.org is a resource on understanding the logic of ggplot better.\nWebsites on how to decide for what visualization to choose:\nhttps://www.data-to-viz.com/\nhttps://datavizcatalogue.com/search.html\nThe number of freely available learning resources is increasing rapidly.\nEveryone has a different learning style and a different background. Thus, different material may be most helpful.\nThis list shall be extended. Good self-study resources for data science with python, mathematics, statistics, data visualization, etc. shall be added here. Contact me if you find something useful to share. Ideally, with a short description when it may be most helpful."

If the activity includes group work, explain the expectations for responsible participation.\nMODULE POLICIES (Optional) Please add any policies unique to this module, such as attendance and active participation. Describe in what ways you provide flexibility for your students and recommendations for preparation from the handbook.\nACADEMIC INTEGRITY All involved parties (professors and lecturers, instructors and students) are expected to abide by the word and spirit of the “Code of Academic Integrity”, which may be reviewed here: https://constructor.university/student-life/student-services/university-policies/academic-policies/code-of-academic-integrity. Violations of the Code might be brought to the attention of the Academic Integrity Committee.\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) USE POLICY Please change the policy to reflect your own policy. This policy covers any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Elicit, etc. This includes text, slides, artwork/graphics/video/audio and other products. 1. You are discouraged from using AI tools UNLESS under direct instruction from your instructor to do so. Please contact your instructor if you are unsure or have questions BEFORE using AI for any assignment. 2. If AI is permitted to be used, you must clearly state how AI was used in completing the assignments. No more than 25% of an assignment should be created with AI if the instructor gives permission for its use. If you are not sure whether a certain usage of AI is permitted for doing your assignments, contact the course instructor. 3. Note that the material generated by these programs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise problematic.  Their use may also stifle your own independent thinking and creativity. Accordingly, reduction in the grade is likely when using AI.\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to your instructor for a conversation before submitting your work.\nFEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS We are eager to constantly improve the quality of our teaching. We would be glad to obtain your feedback at any time of the course to improve your learning experience."

    "text": "This is an excersise combining knowledge about logarithms and probability distributions and a statistical test.\nExercise: Analyzing Data with Benford’s Law in R\nBackground: Benford’s Law, also known as the First-Digit Law, is a phenomenon where in many naturally occurring datasets, the leading digit (i.e., the first digit) is more likely to be small, such as 1, 2, or 3, than it is to be large, such as 8 or 9. This law has applications in fraud detection, financial auditing, and data integrity verification.\nTask: You are given a dataset in a CSV file named data.csv. Your task is to perform the following steps using R and data analytics libraries to determine if the dataset follows Benford’s Law:\nData Loading: Read the data from data.csv into a data frame using read.csv().\n\nData Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Display summary statistics, and visualize the distribution of the first digits in the dataset using a histogram.\n\nCalculate Expected Benford's Law Frequencies: Calculate the expected frequency of each first digit (1 through 9) according to Benford's Law. You can use the formula:\n\nP(d)=log⁡10(d+1)−log⁡10(d)P(d)=log10​(d+1)−log10​(d)\n\nWhere P(d)P(d) is the expected proportion of numbers starting with digit dd.\n\nCompare Observed vs. Expected Frequencies: Calculate the observed frequency of each first digit in the dataset. Compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies from Benford's Law. Create a bar chart or similar visualization to illustrate the comparison.\n\nHypothesis Testing: Perform a statistical hypothesis test to determine if the dataset significantly deviates from Benford's Law. You can use a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test to assess the deviation.\n\nConclusion: Based on the results of your analysis, draw conclusions about whether the dataset follows or deviates from Benford's Law. Explain your findings and their implications.\nNote:\nYou may assume that the dataset contains numerical values.\nYou can use R packages like readr for data reading, and ggplot2 for data visualization.\nInclude comments in your code to explain your approach and calculations.\nProvide clear visualizations and explanations in your final report.\nBonus (Optional): If you’d like to extend this exercise, you can consider applying Benford’s Law to more complex datasets or exploring other variations of the law, such as the Second-Digit Law or the Benford’s Law for Two-Digit Numbers using R."
