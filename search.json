    "section": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy",
    "text": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy\nThis policy covers any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Elicit, etc. This includes text, code, slides, artwork/graphics/video/audio and other products.\nWe instructors encouraged to using and exploring AI tools for these purposes:\n\nLearning by dialog with a chatbot. AI chatbots can be very helpful to explain you concepts on your desired level and get a feeling about how certain topics are treated. You can ask for an easier or more detailed explanation or focus on certain aspects. Note: The capabilities are limited and you likely receive a lot of false information! Using chatbots should remain a small part of your learning process. Rule of thumb: Spend not more than 25% of the learing time with chatting. There is no way around reading textbooks, reading software documentation, learning and understanding concepts, searching for help online, asking instructors or fellow students.\nHave code snippets written. Tools like GitHub Copilot (free to use for students and teachers in VSCode) are heavily used and currently revolutionize code writting a bit. They can speed up writung your code. However, they do not deliver always correct solutions. There is no way around understanding yourself what a code is doing! Do not spend endless hours asking for new code with new prompts, spend time understanding a language and the functions and objects you are using! Copilots can be a great help to get a skeleton of code and an idea how your solution might look, they rarely deliver the complete code, expect that the code does not work, expect that the code seems to works but the results are wrong. You are 100% accountable for the code you produce, with or without the help of a copilot!\nHave a draft text snippet written. Data science is also about formulating and describing research questions, describing data, documenting code, interpreting results, and deriving conclusion form the results. This is all verbal text and chatbots are good in writing text which often appears as well readable. You can use this inspire you and to polish and improve your texts. However, you are 100% accountable for the text you deliver. You are expected to know what your text is about and to be able to answer questions about what your text means! Text generated purely by chatbots, it often becomes evident that you do not. We consider such cases worse than incomplete but sensible text. Also text written by chatbots is often very generic and less specific. In general, we value more specific text higher than generic text. Large parts of very generic text is considered worse than a shorter more specific text. In extreme case, we may a long very generic text will be considered worse than no text at all\nNote: Philosophical and legal questions around the training and use of chatbots and code copilots are controversially contested and re-examined constantly! We encourage to engage with such questions and become aware of arguments and debates.\n\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to us for a conversation before submitting your work."

    "text": "This is an excersise combining knowledge about logarithms and probability distributions and a statistical test.\nExercise: Analyzing Data with Benford’s Law in R\nBackground: Benford’s Law, also known as the First-Digit Law, is a phenomenon where in many naturally occurring datasets, the leading digit (i.e., the first digit) is more likely to be small, such as 1, 2, or 3, than it is to be large, such as 8 or 9. This law has applications in fraud detection, financial auditing, and data integrity verification.\nTask: You are given a dataset in a CSV file named data.csv. Your task is to perform the following steps using R and data analytics libraries to determine if the dataset follows Benford’s Law:\nData Loading: Read the data from data.csv into a data frame using read.csv().\n\nData Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Display summary statistics, and visualize the distribution of the first digits in the dataset using a histogram.\n\nCalculate Expected Benford's Law Frequencies: Calculate the expected frequency of each first digit (1 through 9) according to Benford's Law. You can use the formula:\n\nP(d)=log⁡10(d+1)−log⁡10(d)P(d)=log10​(d+1)−log10​(d)\n\nWhere P(d)P(d) is the expected proportion of numbers starting with digit dd.\n\nCompare Observed vs. Expected Frequencies: Calculate the observed frequency of each first digit in the dataset. Compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies from Benford's Law. Create a bar chart or similar visualization to illustrate the comparison.\n\nHypothesis Testing: Perform a statistical hypothesis test to determine if the dataset significantly deviates from Benford's Law. You can use a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test to assess the deviation.\n\nConclusion: Based on the results of your analysis, draw conclusions about whether the dataset follows or deviates from Benford's Law. Explain your findings and their implications.\nNote:\nYou may assume that the dataset contains numerical values.\nYou can use R packages like readr for data reading, and ggplot2 for data visualization.\nInclude comments in your code to explain your approach and calculations.\nProvide clear visualizations and explanations in your final report.\nBonus (Optional): If you’d like to extend this exercise, you can consider applying Benford’s Law to more complex datasets or exploring other variations of the law, such as the Second-Digit Law or the Benford’s Law for Two-Digit Numbers using R."
